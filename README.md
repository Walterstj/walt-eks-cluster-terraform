I will walk you through how to provision an EKS cluster with Terraform. As you know Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) is a managed service to run Kubernetes on AWS without installing and maintaining your Kubernetes control plane. With AWS EKS, you can create a scalable and highly available cluster using AWS resources.

Terraform explanation:
Terraform is an Infrastructure as code tool for safely and efficiently provisioning infrastructure resources in human-readable configuration files. It is an application that converts configuration files known as HCL (Hashicorp Configuration Language) into real world infrastructure, typically in Cloud providers such as AWS, Azure or Google Cloud Platform.

Docker explanation:
Docker is a tool designed to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. Containers allow a developer to package up an application with all the parts needed, such as libraries and other dependencies, and ship it all out as one package. By doing so, the developer can be assured that the application will run on any other Linux machine regardless of settings.
